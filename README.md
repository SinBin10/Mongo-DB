# Learning about Mongo DB

There is nothing called backend and database, database is a part of backend.

backend contains two servers application server and database server.

Application server:- handles routes (Node in our case)
Database server:- Handles data (Mongo DB)

in sql database data is represented in the form of tables, and in NoSQL(not only sql) data is stored in the form of objects.

Database -> collections -> document

mongoose.connect -> creates a database
model create -> creates collections
CREATE code -> creates document
